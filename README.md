## Summary

Within this repo, I perform a regression and attrition analysis on a study conducted evaluated the impact of deworming on a few economic outcomes. This study is a simplified version of research paper Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming (2021) by Hamory, Joan, Edward Miguel, Michael Walker, Michael Kremer, and Sarah Baird, which can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2023185118). 



## Data

The data has been simplified to complete an assignment for the course [ECON 15510](https://rachel-glennerster.squarespace.com/course-details). I cannot include the data here because it is not my own.
