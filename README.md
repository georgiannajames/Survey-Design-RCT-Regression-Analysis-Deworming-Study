## Summary

Within this repo, I replicate an RCT evaluating the impact of de-worming on a few economic outcomes. First I perform a regression analysis on the effect of de-worming on household earnings and consumption. Next, I perform a gender analysis to look for differential patterns based on gender. Finally, I perform an attrition analysis, to esnure there was no differential attrition that might bias the results of this analysis.  



## About this study

This study is a simplified version of research paper Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming (2021) by Hamory, Joan, Edward Miguel, Michael Walker, Michael Kremer, and Sarah Baird, which can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2023185118). This is a survey design study that evaluates the long term effects of de-worming, by tracking outcomes such as earnings and consumption.

## Data

The data has been simplified to complete an assignment for the course [ECON 15510](https://rachel-glennerster.squarespace.com/course-details). I cannot include the data here because it is not my own.
